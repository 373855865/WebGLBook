Code Examples for Tony Parisi's Book, WebGL Up and Running.

This development branch contains updates to the original book examples to support upgrading to r50 of Three.js.

You can grab the stable version that corresponds with August 2012 release of the book by getting the tag v1.0 (see Tags).

Please note that currently these examples are based on an older version of Three.js (r46). A snapshot of that 
version is included as libs/Three.js. I am currently working on upgrading to the latest stable Three.js (r50). Thanks
for your patience!
